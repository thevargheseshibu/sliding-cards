# Sliding Cards

This is a simple example of sliding cards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you click on a card, it slides and expands, and other cards close.

## How it works

1. `index.html` contains the structure of the webpage with a container and multiple cards.
2. `styles.css` provides the styling for the cards, making them expand on click.
3. `script.js` adds the interactivity. It selects all the cards and adds a click event listener to each. When a card is clicked, it expands, and all other cards are closed.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the expanding cards in action.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this example to create your own interactive card feature.
